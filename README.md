The J-808 is a drum sequencer made using the tone.js library. this application takes inspiration from the legendary Roland TR-808 drum machine.

# How does J-808 work?
The J-808 is a sequencer that allows you to create and edit the pattern of drum beats. It consists of 4 beats, with each beat representing 4 quarter notes. You can enter drum beats by clicking/tapping on the cells to toggle the drum sound on or off.

Once you have created a drum pattern, you can use the play button to loop your drum pattern, or trigger the drum sounds in real-time!
